<p>Welcome <%= @email %>!</p>

<p>You have the option of confirming your account email through the link below:</p>

<p><%= link_to 'Confirm my account', confirmation_url(@resource, :confirmation_token => @resource.confirmation_token) %></p>

<p>Confirming your account allows you to login and see your purchases and status on your purchases.  If you want to pay us via bitcoin, then you'll be able to see the bitcoin address you need to pay in your accounts settings.</p>

<p></p>

<% unless @resource.password.nil? %>
<p>
	Our app has autogenerated a password for you to use to login which you are recommended to change upon your 
	first login ("it's in our servers logs cause we're lazy, lol, plus it passed through gmail so they retain 
	a backup copy of this email for national security purposes"):  
	<%= @resource.password %>
</p>
<% end %>
